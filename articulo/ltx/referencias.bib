	Abstract = {OBJETIVOS: Establecer un sistema de vigilancia intrahospitalaria de la diarrea en ni{\~n}os menores de 5 a{\~n}os, estimar la carga de la enfermedad por rotavirus e identificar los genotipos m{\'a}s frecuentes de rotavirus. 
M{\'E}TODOS: Se incluy{\'o} en este estudio a ni{\~n}os hospitalizados por complicaciones graves de la diarrea en tres centros asistenciales de Santa Fe de Bogot{\'a}, Barranquilla y Cali, Colombia. Se utiliz{\'o} un m{\'e}todo de enzimoinmunoan{\'a}lisis en fase s{\'o}lida (ELISA) para la detecci{\'o}n de rotavirus y un m{\'e}todo de reacci{\'o}n en cadena de la polimerasa con transcripci{\'o}n inversa (RT-PCR) para la genotipificaci{\'o}n. Se determinaron las frecuencias, la tendencia central y la dispersi{\'o}n de las variables. Se realiz{\'o} un an{\'a}lisis estratificado y un an{\'a}lisis con dos variables, mediante una prueba de la c2 o una prueba exacta de Fisher, o una prueba de la c2 para evaluar la tendencia, seg{\'u}n los datos. Se establecieron los riesgos relativos. Para el an{\'a}lisis de la tendencia, se utilizaron la regresi{\'o}n lineal, los coeficientes de correlaci{\'o}n y los valores de P. 
RESULTADOS: Entre diciembre de 2003 y noviembre de 2004 se hospitaliz{\'o} a 893 ni{\~n}os en los tres centros participantes en el estudio, de los cuales el 68% ten{\'\i}a entre 6 y 23 meses de edad. Un 2,7% de los pacientes ingresados presentaba un cuadro de choque hipovol{\'e}mico y un 1,2% falleci{\'o}. Solo un 57% de las madres hab{\'\i}a administrado a sus hijos una soluci{\'o}n de rehidrataci{\'o}n oral antes de la hospitalizaci{\'o}n. La infecci{\'o}n por rotavirus motiv{\'o} un 50% de las hospitalizaciones (coeficiente de correlaci{\'o}n [r]  > 0,8) y se relacion{\'o} con intolerancia a la v{\'\i}a oral (riesgo relativo [RR] = 1,45; intervalo de confianza del 95% [IC95%]: 1,24 -- 1,69; P  < 0,0000) y v{\'o}mito incoercible (RR = 1,47; IC95%: 1,16 -- 1,86; P  < 0,01). La infecci{\'o}n por rotavirus ocasion{\'o} una muerte por cada 2 000 ni{\~n}os; 16 hospitalizaciones por cada 1 000 ni{\~n}os y 631 consultas por cada 1 000 ni{\~n}os. Se identific{\'o} estacionalidad en los genotipos G1P[8], G2P[4] y G3P[8] de rotavirus, que no vari{\'o} a pesar de la distancia geogr{\'a}fica y las diferencias de temperatura, humedad y precipitaci{\'o}n entre las tres ciudades. 
CONCLUSIONES: La infecci{\'o}n por rotavirus es una causa importante de morbilidad y mortalidad por diarrea, especialmente en los primeros a{\~n}os de vida, cuando los ni{\~n}os est{\'a}n m{\'a}s expuestos a las complicaciones graves. Es necesario que las estrategias de prevenci{\'o}n tengan un alto impacto antes de los 6 meses de edad. La vacunaci{\'o}n contra el rotavirus puede ser una buena estrategia complementaria de intervenci{\'o}n. No se encontr{\'o} en la literatura internacional ninguna descripci{\'o}n anterior de la estacionalidad de los genotipos de rotavirus. Es importante hacer estudios de costo-efectividad para favorecer la inversi{\'o}n de recursos seg{\'u}n las necesidades de la poblaci{\'o}n y continuar la vigilancia para ampliar el conocimiento del comportamiento de este virus.},

	Abstract = {OBJETIVO: Determinar la magnitud de la mortalidad por c{\'a}ncer infantil en Colombia y evaluar las tendencias en su evoluci{\'o}n entre 1985 y 2008. 
M{\'E}TODOS: Se analiz{\'o} durante dicho per{\'\i}odo la mortalidad en la poblaci{\'o}n colombiana de 0 a 14 a{\~n}os provocada por c{\'a}ncer en todas las localizaciones -leucemias, tumores malignos del sistema nervioso central (SNC), linfomas no Hodgkin, linfomas Hodgkin, tumores {\'o}seos y tumores renales. Se calcul{\'o} el cambio promedio en las variaciones de las tendencias de mortalidad por c{\'a}ncer en dicho grupo etario. 
RESULTADOS: Las muertes por c{\'a}ncer constituyeron el 3,5% de la mortalidad en menores de 15 a{\~n}os. Entre los per{\'\i}odos 1985-1989 y 2005-2008 las tasas de mortalidad por c{\'a}ncer mostraron un descenso en ambos sexos, pasando de 54,4 muertes por mill{\'o}n a 44,8 muertes por mill{\'o}n en ni{\~n}os y de 40,9 muertes por mill{\'o}n a 37,9 muertes por mill{\'o}n en ni{\~n}as. La mortalidad por leucemias y linfomas registr{\'o} un descenso estad{\'\i}sticamente significativo, mientras que la mortalidad por c{\'a}nceres del SNC, contrariamente, aument{\'o} tambi{\'e}n de manera significativa. 
CONCLUSIONES: Pese a leves tendencias a la baja en la mortalidad por leucemias y linfomas no Hodgkin, las tasas de mortalidad por c{\'a}ncer infantil en Colombia permanecen altas y requieren esfuerzos importantes en los tratamientos para obtener mayores logros.},

@article{Ariely2008a,
	Abstract = {The neo-classical economics view that behavior is driven by - and reflective of - hedonic utility is challenged by psychologists' demonstrations of cases in which actions do not merely reveal preferences but rather create them. In this view, preferences are frequently constructed in the moment and are susceptible to fleeting situational factors; problematically, individuals are insensitive to the impact of such factors on their behavior, misattributing utility caused by these irrelevant factors to stable underlying preferences. Consequently, subsequent behavior might reflect not hedonic utility but rather this erroneously imputed utility that lingers in memory. Here we review the roles of these streams of utility in shaping preferences, and discuss how neuroimaging offers unique possibilities for disentangling their independent contributions to behavior.},

@article{Ariely2002a,
	Abstract = {Procrastination is all too familiar to most people. People delay writing up their research (so we hear!), repeatedly declare they will start their diets tomorrow, or postpone until next week doing odd jobs around the house. Yet people also sometimes attempt to control their procrastination by setting deadlines for themselves. In this article, we pose three questions: (a) Are people willing to self-impose meaningful (i.e., costly) deadlines to overcome procrastination? (b) Are self-imposed deadlines effective in improving task performance? (c) When self-imposing deadlines, do people set them optimally, for maximum performance enhancement? A set of studies examined these issues experimentally, showing that the answer is "yes" to the first two questions, and "no" to the third. People have self-control problems, they recognize them, and they try to control them by self-imposing costly deadlines. These deadlines help people control procrastination, hit they are not as effective as some externally imposed deadlines in improving task performance.},

	Abstract = {Innovation challenges for handling supply chain risks have become one of the most important drivers in business competitiveness and differentiation. This study analyses competitiveness at the external supply chain level as a driver of risks and provides a framework for mitigating these risks. The mitigation framework, also called the supply chain continuity framework, provides insight into six stages of the business continuity planning (BCP) process life cycle (risk mitigation management, business impact analysis, supply continuity strategy development, supply continuity plan development, supply continuity plan testing and supply continuity plan maintenance), together with the operational constructs: customer service, inventory management, flexibility, time to market, ordering cycle time and quality. The purpose of the BCP process life cycle and operational constructs working together is to emphasise the way in which a supply chain can deal with disruption risks and, consequently, bring competitive advantage. Future research will consider the new risk scenarios and analyse the consequences to promote the improvement of supply chain resilience.},

	Abstract = {Does money buy happiness, or does happiness come indirectly from the higher rank in society that money brings? We tested a rank-income hypothesis, according to which people gain utility from the ranked position of their income within a comparison group. The rank hypothesis contrasts with traditional reference-income hypotheses, which suggest that utility from income depends on comparison to a social reference-group norm. We found that the ranked position of an individual's income predicts general life satisfaction, whereas absolute income and reference income have no effect. Furthermore, individuals weight upward comparisons more heavily than downward comparisons. According to the rank hypothesis, income and utility are not directly linked: Increasing an individual's income will increase his or her utility only if ranked position also increases and will necessarily reduce the utility of others who will lose rank.},

The methods considered include the following: the exploitation of age distributions using the `own children' method to estimate age-specific fertility rates by characteristics of the mother; the P/F ratio method for estimating current fertility and its extensions; the calculation of parity progression ratios to detect changes in family-building patterns following the adoption of contraception early in the transition process; methods for estimating childhood and adult mortality, including maternal mortality, from data on the survival of close relatives; the derivation of life tables from such estimates; and the correction of death rates using `growth balance methods'. The paper concludes with a section on possible future improvements in estimation techniques.},

@article{Clark2012a,
	Abstract = {Natural disasters can wreck havoc on business operations. When civil unrest swept the UK in August 2011, the effect on business was stark, losing the retail sector £300m in unexpected costs and lost revenues. On the other side of the world, the natural disaster that hit Japan in early 2011 is estimated to have run up costs in the region of £189bn in repairs. Beyond this, the earthquake and its aftermath shattered supply chains, with technology companies expecting delays of up to six months before business could resume fully. It is impossible to predict incidents like these, but businesses can help mitigate disruption in the supply chain by undertaking business continuity management (BCM). A flexible supply chain is essential when it comes to BCM - whether it means being able to cope with altering transport routes at short notice, or finding or replacing a supplier at the last minute. Understanding the supply chain is critical when responding to major impacts that affect supply chains in multiple points - like IT system failures and country-wide fuel strikes. Businesses should carry out detailed business impact assessments and risk assessments right across the end-to-end supply chain and not just at key single points of failure. It is an intensive process that needs dedicated resources and ownership at the highest level. Recognising this, DHL has designed a 10-step process, which it has implemented across its global supply chain business. This paper provides an overview of what a supply chain really looks like, what can cause disruptions and how far up/down the supply chain companies need to go with their BCM planning.},

The described methodology is implemented in the R-package sspir. A state space model is specified similarly to a generalized linear model in R, and then the time-varying terms are marked in the formula. Special functions for specifying polynomial time trends, harmonic seasonal patterns, unstructured seasonal patterns and time-varying covariates can be used in the formula. The model is fitted to data using iterated extended Kalman filtering, but the formulation of models does not depend on the implemented method of inference. The package is demonstrated on three datasets.},

	Abstract = {We examine the effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on the cost of equity capital for a large sample of US firms. Using several approaches to estimate firms' ex ante cost of equity, we find that firms with better CSR scores exhibit cheaper equity financing. In particular, our findings suggest that investment in improving responsible employee relations, environmental policies, and product strategies contributes substantially to reducing firms' cost of equity. Our results also show that participation in two ``sin'' industries, namely, tobacco and nuclear power, increases firms' cost of equity. These findings support arguments in the literature that firms with socially responsible practices have higher valuation and lower risk.},

@article{Gelman2009,
	Abstract = {Applied researchers often find themselves making statistical inferences in settings that would seem to require multiple comparisons adjustments. We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the \$p\$-values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

	Abstract = {In a world where encounters with dishonesty are frequent, it is important to know if exposure to other people's unethical behavior can increase or decrease an individual's dishonesty. In Experiment 1, our confederate cheated ostentatiously by finishing a task impossibly quickly and leaving the room with the maximum reward. In line with social-norms theory, participants' level of unethical behavior increased when the confederate was an in-group member, but decreased when the confederate was an out-group member. In Experiment 2, our confederate instead asked a question about cheating, which merely strengthened the saliency of this possibility. This manipulation decreased the level of unethical behavior among the other group members. These results suggest that individuals' unethicality does not depend on the simple calculations of cost-benefit analysis, but rather depends on the social norms implied by the dishonesty of others and also on the saliency of dishonesty.},

@article{VonHippel2011a,
	Abstract = {In this article we argue that self-deception evolved to facilitate interpersonal deception by allowing people to avoid the cues to conscious deception that might reveal deceptive intent. Self-deception has two additional advantages: It eliminates the costly cognitive load that is typically associated with deceiving, and it can minimize retribution if the deception is discovered. Beyond its role in specific acts of deception, self-deceptive self-enhancement also allows people to display more confidence than is warranted, which has a host of social advantages. The question then arises of how the self can be both deceiver and deceived. We propose that this is achieved through dissociations of mental processes, including conscious versus unconscious memories, conscious versus unconscious attitudes, and automatic versus controlled processes. Given the variety of methods for deceiving others, it should come as no surprise that self-deception manifests itself in a number of different psychological processes, and we discuss various types of self-deception. We then discuss the interpersonal versus intrapersonal nature of self-deception before considering the levels of consciousness at which the self can be deceived. Finally, we contrast our evolutionary approach to self-deception with current theories and debates in psychology and consider some of the costs associated with self-deception.},

@article{Ioannidis2005a,
	Abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a user study that compares different ways of representing Dual-Scale data charts. Dual-Scale charts incorporate two different data resolutions into one chart in order to emphasize data in regions of interest or to enable the comparison of data from distant regions. While some design guidelines exist for these types of charts, there is currently little empirical evidence on which to base their design. We fill this gap by discussing the design space of Dual-Scale cartesian-coordinate charts and by experimentally comparing the performance of different chart types with respect to elementary graphical perception tasks such as comparing lengths and distances. Our study suggests that cut-out charts which include collocated full context and focus are the best alternative, and that superimposed charts in which focus and context overlap on top of each other should be avoided.},

Estudiar las variaciones de la tasa de mortalidad infantil (TMI) en los departamentos de Colombia durante el per{\'\i}odo 2003-2009, examinar la persistencia de las variaciones entre los departamentos sobre el tiempo y relacionarlas con el impacto de las condiciones socioecon{\'o}micas y la disponibilidad de servicios de salud, sobre la mortalidad infantil. Materiales y m{\'e}todos. Utilizando estad{\'\i}sticas vitales y relacionando datos socioecon{\'o}micos y de servicios de salud, se analizaron tres aspectos: la variaci{\'o}n de la TMI departamental (2003-2009), la relaci{\'o}n entre la TMI departamental y determinantes claves en el tiempo, y las l{\'\i}neas de causalidad e impacto relativo de los diferentes factores. Se emplearan ecuaciones estructurales. Resultados. Se encontr{\'o} una raz{\'o}n de 4,7 entre la mayor y menor TMI departamental (2009), esta podr{\'\i}a estar subestimada principalmente por el subregistros en departamentos de bajos ingresos. Hay una relaci{\'o}n negativa entre la TMI departamental con el tiempo y variables altamente correlacionadas, como educaci{\'o}n de la madre, ingreso per c{\'a}pita, cobertura de aseguramiento y acceso a servicios. Conclusiones. El efecto del aseguramiento, disponibilidad de camas privadas y atenci{\'o}n m{\'e}dica, es superior al impacto de mejores condiciones socioecon{\'o}micas sobre la TMI. La oferta de servicios no parece estar influenciada por una pol{\'\i}tica racional, los recursos no se asignan de acuerdo con las necesidades, sino con el desarrollo general. Las camas privadas se hacen disponibles donde hay mejor aseguramiento en salud y menor TMI},

	Abstract = {The infant mortality rate (IMR) in Colombia has been subject to considerable inconsistent reporting, estimation, and debate. The registered rate for 2009 is 13.69, while the estimated rate by Colombia's Departamento Nacional de Estad{\'\i}stica (DANE) is 20.13. These rates combined with different measurements and estimates of long-term decline, ranging from 2.5 to 7.5 percent, yield even wider discrepancies in IMR for previous years. Taking advantage of all relevant data that have become available -- including 443,338 deaths (1979-2009) and 8,636,510 birth records (1998-2009) -- we establish the most probable range of IMR in Colombia since 1980, including the period 1988 through 1997 for which data on births is lacking. Using the general relationship IMR=αeβt -- where α is the projected initial level of IMR, and β is the average long term rate of annual decline -- we derive α and β from related estimates of infant deaths and birth per 10,000 women age 15-49. Initial estimates set the boundaries for plausible IMR in Colombia for the period based on the registered, 13.69 and estimated, 20.13, rates for 2009, and long term average rates of decline in IMR between 3.8 and 7.6 percent. A further analysis based on other sources, recent developments in vital registration in Colombia, and relevant international experience, lead to a considerable narrower band of most probable IMR for Colombia based on a the range in IMR between 15.5 to 17.5 IMR in 2009 and average long term rates of decline between 4.0 and 6.0 percent, the lower estimates more likely.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents two complementary statistical computing frameworks that address challenges in parallel processing and the analysis of massive data. First, the foreach package allows users of the R programming environment to define parallel loops that may be run sequentially on a single machine, in parallel on a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) machine, or in cluster environments without platform-specific code. Second, the bigmemory package implements memory- and file-mapped data structures that provide (a) access to arbitrarily large data while retaining a look and feel that is familiar to R users and (b) data structures that are shared across processor cores in order to support efficient parallel computing techniques. Although these packages may be used independently, this paper shows how they can be used in combination to address challenges that have effectively been beyond the reach of researchers who lack specialized software development skills or expensive hardware.},

@article{King2001,
	Abstract = {We study rare events data, binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than zeros (``nonevents''). In many literatures, these variables have proven dif- ficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sam- pling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99\% of their (nonfixed) data collection costs or to collect much more meaningful ex- planatory variables.We provide methods that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections towork simultaneously, and software that implements the methods developed.

	Abstract = {Although Bayesian models of mind have attracted great interest from cognitive scientists, Bayesian methods for data analysis have not. This article reviews several advantages of Bayesian data analysis over traditional null-hypothesis significance testing. Bayesian methods provide tremendous flexibility for data analytic models and yield rich information about parameters that can be used cumulatively across progressive experiments. Because Bayesian statistical methods can be applied to any data, regardless of the type of cognitive model (Bayesian or otherwise) that motivated the data collection, Bayesian methods for data analysis will continue to be appropriate even if Bayesian models of mind lose their appeal.},

	Abstract = {Seven low-cost digesters in Costa Rica were studied to determine the potential of these systems to treat animal wastewater and produce renewable energy. The effluent water has a significantly lower oxygen demand (COD decreased from 2,968 mg/L to 472 mg/L) and higher dissolved nutrient concentration (NH(4)-N increased by 78.3\% to 82.2mg/L) than the influent water, which increases the usefulness of the effluent as an organic fertilizer and decreases its organic loading on surface waters. On average, methane constituted 66\% of the produced biogas, which is consistent with industrial digesters. Through principle component analysis, COD, turbidity, NH(4)-N, TKN, and pH were determined to be the most useful parameters to characterize wastewater. The results suggest that the systems have the ability to withstand fluctuations in the influent water quality. This study revealed that small-scale agricultural digesters can produce methane at concentrations useful for cooking, while improving the quality of the livestock wastewater.},

	Abstract = {In three experiments, we examined the mere-measurement effect, wherein simply asking people about their intent to engage in a certain behavior increases the probability of their subsequently engaging in that behavior. The experiments demonstrate that manipulations that should affect the ease of mentally representing or simulating the behavior in question influence the extent of the mere-measurement phenomenon. Participants who were asked about their intention to engage in various behaviors were more likely to engage in those behaviors than participants not asked about their intentions in situations in which mentally simulating the behavior in the intention question was relatively easy. We tested this ease-of-representation hypothesis using both socially desirable and socially undesirable behaviors, and our dependent variables comprised both self-reports and actual behaviors. Our findings have implications for survey research in various social contexts, including assessments of risky behaviors by public health organizations.},

	Abstract = {Carrying out critical business functions without interruption requires a resilient and robust business continuity framework. By embedding an industry-standard incident management system within its business continuity structure, the Bank of Canada strengthened its response plan by enabling timely response to incidents while maintaining a strong focus on business continuity. A total programme approach, integrating the two disciplines, provided for enhanced recovery capabilities. While the value of an effective and efficient response organisation is clear, as demonstrated by emergency events around the world, incident response structures based on normal operating hierarchy can experience unique challenges. The internationally-recognised Incident Command System (ICS) model addresses these issues and reflects the five primary incident management functions, each contributing to the overall strength and effectiveness of the response organisation. The paper focuses on the Bank of Canada's successful implementation of the ICS model as its incident management and continuity of operations programmes evolved to reflect current best practices.},

	Abstract = {The endowment effect--the tendency for owners (potential sellers) to value objects more than potential buyers do--is among the most widely studied judgment and decision-making phenomena. However, the current research is the first to explore whether the effect varies across cultures. Given previously demonstrated cultural differences in self-construals and self-enhancement, we predicted a smaller endowment effect for East Asians compared with Westerners. Two studies involving buyers and sellers of a coffee mug (Study 1a) and a box of chocolates (Study 1b) supported this prediction. Study 2 conceptually replicated this cultural difference by experimentally manipulating independent and interdependent self-construals. Finally, Study 3 provided evidence for an underlying self-enhancement mechanism: Cultural differences emerged when self-object associations were made salient, but disappeared when self-object associations were minimized. Thus, the endowment effect may be influenced by the degree to which independence and self-enhancement (vs. interdependence and self-criticism) are culturally valued or normative.},

This method improves on the established methodology by avoiding assumptions that tend to reduce the final hydraulic retention time (HRT) of digesters once installed. This work recommends designing the digester using trench cross-sectional area and proposes an optimization of the trench dimensions with respect to the angle of the walls and the relationship between the length of the biogas bell and the top width of the trench. The influence of the biogas pressure is considered. A simple geometrical analysis is presented that, by parameterization, can be applied in a wide range of situations.},

@article{Porter2008a,
	Abstract = {In 1979, a young associate professor at Harvard Business School published his first article for HBR, "How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy." In the years that followed, Michael Porter's explication of the five forces that determine the long-run profitability of any industry has shaped a generation of academic research and business practice. In this article, Porter undertakes a thorough reaffirmation and extension of his classic work of strategy formulation, which includes substantial new sections showing how to put the five forces analysis into practice. The five forces govern the profit structure of an industry by determining how the economic value it creates is apportioned. That value may be drained away through the rivalry among existing competitors, of course, but it can also be bargained away through the power of suppliers or the power of customers or be constrained by the threat of new entrants or the threat of substitutes. Strategy can be viewed as building defenses against the competitive forces or as finding a position in an industry where the forces are weaker. Changes in the strength of the forces signal changes in the competitive landscape critical to ongoing strategy formulation. In exploring the implications of the five forces framework, Porter explains why a fast-growing industry is not always a profitable one, how eliminating today's competitors through mergers and acquisitions can reduce an industry's profit potential, how government policies play a role by changing the relative strength of the forces, and how to use the forces to understand complements. He then shows how a company can influence the key forces in its industry to create a more favorable structure for itself or to expand the pie altogether. The five forces reveal why industry profitability is what it is. Only by understanding them can a company incorporate industry conditions into strategy.},

	Abstract = {This study provides the first evidence that money impairs people's ability to savor everyday positive emotions and experiences. In a sample of working adults, wealthier individuals reported lower savoring ability (the ability to enhance and prolong positive emotional experience). Moreover, the negative impact of wealth on individuals' ability to savor undermined the positive effects of money on their happiness. We experimentally exposed participants to a reminder of wealth and produced the same deleterious effect on their ability to savor as that produced by actual individual differences in wealth, a result supporting the theory that money has a causal effect on savoring. Moving beyond self-reports, we found that participants exposed to a reminder of wealth spent less time savoring a piece of chocolate and exhibited reduced enjoyment of it compared with participants not exposed to wealth. This article presents evidence supporting the widely held but previously untested belief that having access to the best things in life may actually undercut people's ability to reap enjoyment from life's small pleasures.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Only limited data are available on US business continuity activities related to biologic events.

METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to human resource professionals during May-July 2011 to assess business continuity related to biologic events, incentives businesses are providing to maximize worker surge capacity, and seasonal influenza vaccination policy. Linear regressions were used to describe factors associated with higher business continuity and pandemic preparedness scores. The $\chi$(2) and Fisher exact tests compared health care versus non-health care businesses on preparedness indicators.

RESULTS: Possible business continuity and pandemic preparedness scores ranged from 0.5 to 27 and 0 to 15, with average resulting scores among participants at 13.2 and 7.3, respectively. Determinants of business continuity and pandemic preparedness were (1) business size (larger businesses were more prepared), (2) type of business (health care more prepared), (3) having human resource professional as company disaster planning committee member, and (4) risk perception of a pandemic in the next year. Most businesses (63.3\%, n = 298) encourage staff influenza vaccination; 2.1\% (n = 10) mandate it. Only 10\% of businesses (11.0\%, n = 52) provide employee incentives, and fewer than half (41.0\%, n = 193) stockpile personal protective equipment.

CONCLUSION: Despite the recent H1N1 pandemic, many US businesses lack adequate pandemic plans. It is critical that businesses of all sizes and types become better prepared for a biologic event.},

It discusses potential performance consequences resulting from applying BCM aspects/elements within an organisation. The paper contributes to the understanding of the role of BCM in OP by discussing how deployment of BCM key aspects/elements can improve OP. Two main issues are discussed: first, background to performance and the elements of OP; and secondly, the role of BCM in achieving optimised OP. These issues are significant, as they go further than the extant literature relating to the significance of BCM and its potential influence on OP. The study focuses on Jordanian banks as a case study and as a way of illustrating how BCM helps improve OP for those organisations facing performance shortcomings or difficulties.},

@article{schell2007,
	Abstract = {Background: To reach the Millennium Development Goals for health, influential international bodies advocate for more resources to be directed to the health sector, in particular medical treatment. Yet, health has many determinants beyond the health sector that are less evident than proximate predictors. Aim: To assess the relative importance of major socioeconomic determinants of population health, measured as infant mortality rate (IMR), at country level. Methods: National-level data from 152 countries based on World Development Indicators 2003 were used for multivariate linear regression analyses of five socioeconomic predictors of IMR: public spending on health, GNI/capita, poverty rate, income equality (Gini index), and young female illiteracy rate. Analyses were performed on a global level and stratified for low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Results: In order of importance, GNI/capita, young female illiteracy, and income equality predicted 92% of the variation in national IMR whereas public spending on health and poverty rate were non-significant determinants when adjusted for confounding. In low-income countries, female illiteracy was more important than GNI/capita. Income equality (Gini index) was an independent predictor of IMR in middle-income countries only. In high-income countries none of these predictors was significant. Conclusions: The relative importance of major health determinants varies between income levels, thus extrapolating health policies from high- to low-income countries is problematic.
Since the size, per se, of public health spending does not independently predict health outcomes, functioning health systems are necessary to make health investments efficient. Potential health gains from improved female education and economic growth should be considered in low- and middle-income countries},

@article{Sheth2008a,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes an approach for designing a business continuity management system (BCMS) dashboard constructed using resiliency capability levels. The dashboard ensures the ability to track and baseline the present capability level and focus on the activities that would help leapfrog into the higher capability levels; it also provides guidance for governance. The model is based on the building blocks of a comprehensive BCMS and SMART maturity levels (ie specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound). In terms of principles of maturity, the dashboard draws its inspiration from the Software Engineering Institute's capability maturity model. However, the commonalities end there, as the components of a BCMS are different from those of software development. This customer-centric paper addresses the need of professionals who are entrusted with developing, implementing and validating business continuity and disaster recovery plans. The paper does not address the technologies used for backing up and recovering systems, platforms, databases and applications or the contents of a business impact analysis survey, risk assessment, vital records plan, emergency response procedures, disaster recovery plans etc.},

@article{Soyer2012a,
	Abstract = {Does the manner in which results are presented in empirical studies affect perceptions of the predictability of the outcomes? Noting the predominant role of linear regression analysis in empirical economics, we asked 257 academic economists to make probabilistic inferences based on different presentations of the outputs of this statistical tool. The questions concerned the distribution of the dependent variable, conditional on known values of the independent variable. The answers based on the presentation mode that is standard in the literature demonstrated an illusion of predictability; the outcomes were perceived to be more predictable than could be justified by the model. In particular, many respondents failed to take the error term into account. Adding graphs did not improve the inference. Paradoxically, the respondents were more accurate when only graphs were provided (i.e., no regression statistics). The implications of our study suggest, inter alia, the need to reconsider the way in which empirical results are presented, and the possible provision of easy-to-use simulation tools that would enable readers of empirical papers to make accurate inferences.},

Probabilities are notoriously difficult to communicate effectively to lay audiences, and in this review we examine current practice for communicating uncertainties visually, using examples drawn from sport, weather, climate, health, economics, and politics. Despite the burgeoning interest in infographics, there is limited experimental evidence on how different types of visualizations are processed and understood, although the effectiveness of some graphics clearly depends on the relative numeracy of an audience. Fortunately, it is increasingly easy to present data in the form of interactive visualizations and in multiple types of representation that can be adjusted to user needs and capabilities. Nonetheless, communicating deeper uncertainties resulting from incomplete or disputed knowledge--or from essential indeterminacy about the future--remains a challenge.},

@article{Strong2010a,
	Abstract = {The popular axiom, 'what gets measured gets done', is often applied in the quality management and continuous improvement disciplines. This truism is also useful to business continuity practitioners as they continually strive to prove the value of their organisation's investment in a business continuity management (BCM) programme. BCM practitioners must also remain relevant to their organisations as executives focus on the bottom line and maintaining stakeholder confidence. It seems that executives always find a way, whether in a hallway or elevator, to ask BCM professionals about the company's level of readiness. When asked, they must be ready with an informed response. The establishment of a process to measure business continuity programme performance and organisational readiness has emerged as a key component of US Department of Homeland Security 'Voluntary Private Sector Preparedness (PS-Prep) Program' standards where the overarching goal is to improve private sector preparedness for disasters and emergencies. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: to introduce continuity professionals to best practices that should be considered when developing a BCM metrics programme as well as providing a case study of how a large health insurance company researched, developed and implemented a process to measure BCM programme performance and company readiness.},

These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgements and decisions in situations of uncertainty.},

The paper describes the various segments of a comprehensive business continuity, disaster recovery and crisis management programme and then delves into the variables that determine the appropriate number of professionals required for the company. It is a thought-provoking examination that can help anybody in the `c-suite' examine their particular requirements, characteristics and culture to determine appropriate staffing levels. The reader will have a quantitative approach for determining the size and structure of a resilient enterprise which can provide a solid foundation for a programme that adapts and adjusts quickly and cost-effectively to disasters and events. It can also help build executive support for a programme management office which could ultimately increase the overall success of the programme.},

@article{Ward2008a,
	Abstract = {It is in the interest of operators of anaerobic digestion plants to maximise methane production whilst concomitantly reducing the chemical oxygen demand of the digested material. Although the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion is not a new idea, commercial anaerobic digestion processes are often operated at well below their optimal performance due to a variety of factors. This paper reviews current optimisation techniques associated with anaerobic digestion and suggests possible areas where improvements could be made, including the basic design considerations of a single or multi-stage reactor configuration, the type, power and duration of the mixing regime and the retention of active microbial biomass within the reactor. Optimisation of environmental conditions within the digester such as temperature, pH, buffering capacity and fatty acid concentrations is also discussed. The methane-producing potential of various agriculturally sourced feedstocks has been examined, as has the advantages of co-digestion to improve carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and the use of pre-treatments and additives to improve hydrolysis rates or supplement essential nutrients which may be limiting. However, perhaps the greatest shortfall in biogas production is the lack of reliable sensory equipment to monitor key parameters and suitable, parallelised control systems to ensure that the process continually operates at optimal performance. Modern techniques such as software sensors and powerful, flexible controllers are capable of solving these problems. A direct comparison can be made here with, for instance, oil refineries where a more mature technology uses continuous in situ monitoring and associated feedback procedures to routinely deliver continuous, optimal performance.},

This paper attempts to tackle a small, but important, subset of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy data is easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and has a specific structure: variables are stored in columns, observations in rows, and one type of experimental unit per file. This structure makes it easy to tidy messy data, because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a large number of messy data sets. Tidy data is only useful in conjunction with tidy tools, tools that input and output tidy data. Tidy tools for manipulation, modelling, and visualisation are described, and the notion of tidy tools is used to critique existing messy tools.},

We pull these opposing poles closer with two new techniques for rigorous statistical inference of visual discoveries. The "Rorschach" helps the analyst calibrate their understanding of uncertainty and "line-up" provides a protocol for assessing the significance of visual discoveries, protecting against the discovery of spurious structure.},

	Abstract = {Despite its rapid development in the last two decades, business continuity management (BCM) as a discipline and a profession is still regarded by many as an operational entity of management. Two main issues are discussed in this paper: the role of BCM in strategic management and the strategic skills of business continuity managers. These issues are crucial as they represent the role of BCM in high-level corporate management. The paper discusses the importance of BCM in the long-term planning of organisational success and the preservation of future competitiveness. Finally, salient points that underpin the importance of its role in sustaining organisational performance are addressed.},
